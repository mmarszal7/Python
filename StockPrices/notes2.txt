This script is a basic application of a machine learning
https://github.com/Vaibhav/Stock-Analysis

Algorithm to predict stock prices using Python libraries.

This script uses regression learners to predict the stock price for
the second half of this period based on the values of the ... {column names}

This is a naive approach, because most methods predicts relative rather than
absolute values (deviation from previous state).

1 Slide Topic and Regression (screen from scikitlearn), more development than scientific approach!
Regression is a technique that displays the relationship between variable “y” based on the values of variable “x”.
We know as the temperature drops people put on more jackets to keep warm or as the fuel price increases more people drive less to save money.

Script is divided is 4 parts (whitch is pretty standard for machine learning problems (read, process data, learn & test, plot)):
- reading data from .* and saving it into pandas DataFrame (nothing special)
- normalizing and dividing data into training and learning sets (scaling, divinding)
- prepearing SVMs, fitting data and predicting future values (about svm, creating SVM, fitting data, predicting)
- plotting results (nothing)

This is only sample, and regression algorithms can be used in many cases (mostly forecasting):
- signals (failures)
- weather
- economical income / productivity (customer waiting (queue) time and customer satisfaction)(ticket prices and attendance)
- trends and relationships (generaly)
